  <p>Hello, Iâ€™m Edwar!</p>
  <p>
    I'm a developer who started in this industry because of my curiosity about
    how things work. My curiosity carried me to the computer world. Now I'm a
    happy developer who loves how dynamic the world of development is.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm always looking to learn new things and improving the way I work, meeting
    new people on the way, learning from them and sharing my knowledge with
    them.
  </p>
  <p>
    I consider myself a fullstack web developer, who is mainly focused on
    front-end . I'd like to mention that I love to work in the terminal. I'm a
    Vim lover.
